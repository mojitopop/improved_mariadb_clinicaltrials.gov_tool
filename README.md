Overview of some of the tables this script creates. ( doesn't show tables related to cohort baselines characteristics, secondary ID&PMID references)
Red variables represent values that were modified by the scripts


// You need to have all the MariaDB drivers installed beforehand in order to use this

NB : some tables and informations are very redundant, this was done purposely in order to have a fast visual access to all the information needed instead of having to perform a MySQL query every time i wanted to join tables or see real text values instead of foreign keys.

The db schema can be found in the rep

List of changes :
 - regex the lead sponsors / orgas names in order to refine the class OTHER into UNIVERSITY,HOSPITAL and NETWORK
 - format dates to YYYY-MM-DD
 - fetch THEORICAL ENROLLMENT COUNT, instead of just LAST ENROLLMENT COUNT ( if you want to do predictive models and it sees a Phase 3 trial with only 5 patients it'll obviously knows it's a TERMINATED trial => data leakage )
 - location of the trial : for multi-centers trials, instead of assigning the first center's location in the list as the official country, we will take the location of the responsible party and use an external GoogleMapsGeocoding API to determine the country of the trial.
